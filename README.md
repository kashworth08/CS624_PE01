<h1>Input</h1>
<p> While there is no user input for this code, the code relies on StyleSheet, View, and Text components from React Native.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>The package.json calls out the starting point for the code which is in the app folder. Index.tsx is called and contains very basic code for displaying a name, major, and school. 3 different text components were defined in the style sheet with different styles which is why the name is bolded and each line contains slightly smaller font. The style sheet also defines the background as being yellow. </p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>The output is an app page that contains my name, major, and school on a yellow background.</p>
